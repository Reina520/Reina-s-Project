In order to help You better understand the potential risks and, in accordance with relevant laws, regulations, administrative rules and relevant state policies, we hereby advise You of the risks that may be involved in margin trading, which we encourage you to read carefully, which include but are not limited to-:</string>
    <string name="margin_risk_reminder_hint6">(1)The risks of digital assets themselves: the digital asset market is a brand new and unverified market that may or may not grow. At present, digital assets are mostly used by speculators, and less used in retailing and commercial markets; therefore, the price of digital assets is volatile and prone to fluctuations, which may further adversely affect the investment in digital assets. Unlike the stock market, the digital asset market does not have any limit up and down, and the trading on the digital asset market is open 24 hours a day. The price of digital assets may fluctuate greatly because: (i) the number of chips is relatively small; (ii) the market prices are vulnerable to control by the market makers; and (iii) the influence of regulatory policies of countries concerned, among others. The price may rise several times or fall by half in a single day. Therefore, You must understand and agree that You will be solely responsible for any and all the economic losses caused to You due to the digital assets themselves.</string>
    <string name="margin_risk_reminder_hint7">(2)Policy Risks: Digital asset transactions may be suspended or prohibited at any time due to the formulation or modification of applicable laws, rules and regulations for digital assets in various jurisdictions. You must understand and agree that due to the formulation or modification of applicable laws, regulations and regulatory documents, the transaction of digital assets may be suspended or prohibited, and any and all economic losses as a result therefrom shall be borne by You.</string>

    <string name="margin_risk_reminder_hint12">(7)Other Risks: You shall bear any and all losses arising in any of the following situations: (a) losses you sustain due to such factors as lost account ID, forgotten password, improper operation, and investment decision-making mistakes; (b) losses caused by any malicious operation of Your account by any third party because you engage in online entrustment or You fail to log out after hot-key operation through Your account; (c) losses caused by You entrusting any other person to carry out margin trading on this Website on Your behalf; (d) Losses caused by any other accident and factors not attributable to this Website.</string>

    <string name="index_setting_abstract_content">MA (or moving average) is a technical indicator formed by linking the arithmetic average of closing prices over a period. It can be used to reflect the trend of stock price.</string>
    <string name="index_setting_huo_to_use">Usage</string>
    <string name="index_setting_ma_content">MA is formed by linking the arithmetic average of closing prices over a period. It can smooth short-term fluctuations and reflect long-term trends or cycles.</string>
    <string name="index_setting_boll_content">Also known as Bollinger bands, BOLL is basically a banded channel consisting of three bands (one in the middle, one placed above and one placed below). The middle band is the average cost of the price, and the upper and lower band can be regarded as the resistence and support band respectively.</string>
    <string name="index_setting_macd_content">MACD consists of a set of curves and graphs. It\'s the difference between a fast and a slow exponential moving average (EMA) of the closing price. \"S\" refers to shorter-period EMA and \"L\" refers to longer-period EMA. The most commonly used values are 12-day and 26-day EMA.</string>
    <string name="index_setting_kdj_content">KDJ calculates the immature random value of the last calculation period with the highest price &amp; the lowest price in a certain period (usually 9 days, 9 weeks, etc.), the closing price of the last calculation period, and the ratio between these three figures. Then it calculates K, D and J value according to EXPMA, and develops a curve for prediction of the price trend.</string>
    <string name="index_setting_rsi_content">RSI is a technical analysis tool that moves up and down to respond to market change rates. The 14-day RSI is the most effective one.</string>
    <string name="index_setting_wr_content">WR is a type of momentum indicator that moves between 0 and -100 and indicates overbought and oversold levels. It measures the rate of price spread of peak value (highest price) created by the long interest and short interest and the daily closing price, and the price fluctuation range over a certain period of time (such as 7 days, 14 days, 28 days, etc.), in order to reflect signals of price trend.</string>

    <string name="market_info_tab_index_ingredients">Component Coins</string>
    <string name="market_info_tab_index_intro">Introduction</string>
    <string name="market_info_tab_index_intro_value">Huobi 10 Index is composed of 10 coins that are listed on Huobi and have the higher market value, larger scale and better circulation to reflect the overall performance of Huobi Pro\'s market. \nThe sample space is all listed coins that are traded against USDT at Huobi Pro. According to the different properties of the blockchain assets, they can be divided into four categories: \"coin\", \"platform\", \"application\" and \"real asset token\". \nThe \"coin\" refers to an asset developed on the basis of blockchain technology that does not correspond to a specific use case and whose main function is only the subject of the transaction, the value of which is mainly reflected through liquidity; \nThe “platform” coin refers to the asset associated with development of the underlying blockchain technology and supported by the right to use or to participate in the platform; \nThe “application” coin refers to the asset associated with a specific application scenario and supported by a certain right to use, participation or dividend; \nThe “real asset token” refers to digital currencies that are linked with gold, US dollar and other actual assets. \nOn this basis, Huobi 10 Index is calculated by the formula of Pasche weighted composite price index, with the average daily trading volume of the previous quarter taken as a core index of sample selection. \nThe daily average data can reduce the impact of single-day price volatility and better reflect the liquidity of digital assets during the audit period. In addition, this index will determine the proportion of index components of different types of blockchain assets according to the sum of the average daily trading volume of each type of blockchain assets in the previous quarter, so as to comprehensively reflect the overall performance of blockchain assets listed on Huobi and reflect the overall development of all kinds of blockchain technology applications.</string>
