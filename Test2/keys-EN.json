As bargaining chips of digital assets are relatively fewer, the price of digital assets may be subject to major fluctuations caused by market-makers’ control and global government policies, and may even rise or drop by several times within one day. In view of this, any and all financial losses attributable to the digital assets themselves shall be borne solely by you.<br><br>(2) Policy risks: trading in digital assets may be suspended or prohibited at any time due to the adoption or modification of any applicable law, regulation and regulatory document in relevant countries.

All of the above losses will be borne by you exclusively.<br><br>(8) Special reminder: if you participate in the lending transactions on this Website, you shall properly control the risks, assess the value and risks of investment in digital assets at your own discretion, and bear the financial risk that all your investment may be lost; you shall base your transaction on your own financial conditions and risk-bearing capacity, and clearly recognize the risks of digital assets investment.
